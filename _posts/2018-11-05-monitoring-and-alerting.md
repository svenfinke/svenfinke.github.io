title: Monitoring and Alerting
---
Monitoring and Alerting are often mentioned together. Alerting simply does not work without monitoring and monitoring is outmost useless if there is no alerting. Let's talk about the fact that these two are often confused with one another and why most of the standard alerting is quite useless.

## Definition

**Monitoring** is a process to collect and analyze data from any source, may it be hardware metrics, application data or system log files.

**Alerting** will inform a predefined set of people over a specific notification channel if a specific condition is met.

## Let's focus

Let me focus on alerting for pretty much the rest of the post. But at the end you will also have a good idea what proper monitoring may look like.
