## Tips

I have no idea if you can get "Zigeuner Sauce" outside of Germany... I prefer the one made by the brand "Homann". It is mainly made of mashed tomatoes, bell pepper and onions. Probably spiced with hot paprika, vinegar, salt and pepper. It might acutally be a fun idea to try to rebuild this sauce from scratch... 

You can also turn this into a lasagna. Instead of cooking it for 10 minutes, just heat it up and let it cook for 2 minutes. Then add layers of lasagna plates and the sauce into a casserole or baking dish. Top it of with Bechamel Sauce or mix Creme fraiche with some milk and season with salt and pepper. Then add a ton of cheese and put it into the oven at 180Â° until the cheese is golden brown.
