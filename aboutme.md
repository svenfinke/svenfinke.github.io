My name is Sven Finke. This blog may help you out if you try to find out anything about me. I'm a developer, devop, photographer, cook and gamer. So in the future you may find anything about one of these topics on this blog. This might become the perfect mix of searching for a solution for a complicated problem, finding an answer and also being provided with a recipe for nice munchies to get you through the process of fixing everything that went wrong.

# History

- Developing since 2005
- Cooking since I was ~8 years old
- Taking photos with the Sony Alpha 6000 of my wife, since my Nex F-3 broke a few months ago...
- Playing Videogames since my parents got me a GameBoy when I went into school

I guess that is the most important stuff that everyone looked for.
